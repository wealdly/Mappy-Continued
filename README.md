# Mappy-Continued

A continuation of [Mappy](https://github.com/Mundocani/Mappy) addon for World of Warcraft, originally created by [Mundocani](https://github.com/Mundocani).

Compatible with Midnight!

Since the original addon seems pretty much abandoned, I've decided to fork and maintain it. I love this addon too much to find a new one, so I've fixed it instead!

Please bear in mind that I'm not planning on adding new features nor refactoring the code. I want to maintain the currently implemented features with as little modifications of the original codebase as possible. There will be some dirty hacks, which I might pretty-up later.

I _might_ add some new things if you ask for any, but it's going to be a case-by-case thing.

## Features

Mappy-Continued is a minimap addon focused on changing the minimap shape into a sleek square.

Other features include:
* Resizing of the minimap
* Option to move the minimap via Edit Mode only
* Option to move the minimap via addon settings only
* Automatic stacking of minimap buttons along the minimap OR screen
* Pretty-ing the stock Calendar, Mail and Tracking buttons to actually look like buttons
* Zooming in and out with the mouse wheel
* Alpha settings, separate for combat, movement and default state
* Profiles (including being able to set a profile for mounting, dungeon etc)
* Gathering overlay support for Gatherer and GatherMate
* Compatibility with MinimapButtonBag Reborn
* Compatibility with FarmHud
* ~~Bigger and/or blinking gathering nodes~~ - **No longer possible since 12.0.7**
